# ShiftLight
Quartus(13.0 spl) based circuit for Shift Light

The circuit found here is for a shift light which is a light typically located by the cluster gauge of a manual car in order to know when to shift gears. The light will turn on depending on the RPM value from the cluster gauge as well as the set value for when the light should turn on. The value set will also a RPM value that will range from 0-15k RPM.

The motive behind making this device was to create something that I found interest in which is racing and from there I thought of my current build(Mazda Protege). I was thinking of buying a shift light for my own car and as soon as I realized I needed to make a final project for a class (CPE 100L), I realized it would be a pretty good idea to make this shift light on my own in order to later use it on my own car to allow it to be modified in any shape or form that I want as I would plan to combine this circuit with the carâ€™s ECU(Electronic Control Unit aka Car Computer).
